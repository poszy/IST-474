    If you are prompted for login information, specify:

        Username: Enter system for the user name.

        Password: Enter the password that was specified when Oracle Database XE was installed.

2 Unlocking the Sample User Account

To view any objects owned by the supplied sample database user named HR, or to create the form-based application as described in Section 6, "Creating an Application Using Application Express", you must first unlock the HR sample account.

Oracle Database XE comes with a sample database user named HR. This user owns several database tables in a sample schema for a fictional Human Resources department. However, for security reasons, this user's account is locked. You need to unlock this account before you can view the HR objects or build any applications that use these objects. You can use either of the following approaches to unlock the account:

    Display the SQL command prompt window. For example, on Windows, click Start, then Programs (or All Programs), then Oracle Database 11g Express Edition, and then Run SQL Command Line.

    Connect as the SYSTEM user:

        Type: connect

        Enter user-name: system

        Enter password: <password-for-system>

    Enter the following statement to unlock the HR account:

    SQL> ALTER USER hr ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

    Enter a statement in the following form to specify the password that you want for the HR user:

    SQL> ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY <hr-password>;

    Optionally, exit SQL*Plus (which also closes the command window):

    SQL> exit

3 Working with Oracle Table

In this section, you work with Oracle tables using basic SQL.  The exercise focuses on hr, the sample human resources database you activated above.  Before starting the exercise, explore the HR database schema, using these helpful hints as needed.

    Study the HR database schema linked here: Database Sample Schemas (look under “Schema Diagrams”).
        List all of HR user’s tables by logging in as the hr user and running SELECT table_name FROM user_tables; .
	    Display a detailed table schema using DESCRIBE tablename;

Create a command file, assignment01_1.sql , and add SQL queries and explanations to:

    List all the rows of the departments table.
        Find the number of employees in the database (hint: use the COUNT() aggregate function for this);
	    List the employees who:
	            have a salary greater than 15000,
		            were hired between January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2005,
			            have a phone number that doesn't start with 515
				        List the names of the employees who are in the finance department. Try to format the names as “firstname lastname” using concatenation (i.e., ||) and order them alphabetically.
					    List the city, state and country name for all locations in the Asian region.
					        List the locations that have no state or province specified in the database.
						    Oracle provides a default table named dual, which you can usr to verify that OracleXE is up and running. Try to figure out the schema and the data values stored in dual.  Give examples of why one might want to user such a table.

4 Creating a Database User

You should create at least one database user that you will use to create database objects. A database user is a type of database object: a user is associated with a database schema, you connect to the database as a database user, and the database user is the owner of any database objects (tables and so on) that you create in the schema associated with the user.

For example, to create a database user named chris. Follow these steps, using the command line:

        Display the SQL command prompt window. For example, on Windows, click Start, then Programs (or All Programs), then Oracle Database 11g Express Edition, and then Run SQL Command Line.

        Connect as the SYSTEM user:

            Type: connect

            Enter user-name: system

            Enter password: <password-for-system>

        Create the user. For example, enter a statement in the following form:

        SQL> create user chris identified by <password-for-chris>;

        Grant the user the necessary privileges. For example:

        SQL> grant CREATE SESSION, ALTER SESSION, CREATE DATABASE LINK, -
	          CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM, -
		            CREATE ROLE, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE SYNONYM, CREATE TABLE, -
			              CREATE TRIGGER, CREATE TYPE, CREATE VIEW, UNLIMITED TABLESPACE -
				                to chris;

        Optionally, exit SQL*Plus (which also closes the command window):

        SQL> exit

5 Working with Oracle Integrity Constraints

You now will consider a sample command file that defines a simple movie database with some sample data.  Study the movie database code in movie.sql so that you know how command file works.  In particular, consider the purpose of the StatusValue table.

Try the following, noting what happens and why.  Store your DDL/DML commands along with explanations of how/why they work in assignment01_2.sql

    Try adding records to the movie relation that cause these intra-relation issues:
            a repeated primary key value
	            a NULL primary key value
		            a violation of a CHECK constraint
			            a violation of an SQL datatype constraint
				            a negative score value
					        Try adding records that cause these inter-relation issues:
						        a new record with a NULL value for a foreign key value
							        a foreign key value in a referencing (aka child) table that doesn’t match any key value in the referenced (aka parent) table
								        a key value in a referenced table with no related records in the referencing table
									    Try deleting/modifying records as follows:
									            Delete a referenced record that is referenced by a referencing record.
										            Delete a referencing record that references a referenced record.
											            Modify the ID of a movie record that is referenced by a casting record.

Note that though the text discusses it, Oracle doesn’t support ON UPDATE CASCADE. Would supporting such a feature be a good idea? See Ask Tom’s discussion of this.

    The original IMDB Movie table included fields for both score and votes. Can you add a constraint the requires that all movies having a non-NULL score value must also have more than 1000 votes? If so, explain what constraint you’d specify; if not, include an explanation of why it’s not possible.
        Database systems, including Oracle, allow DBAs to create separate constraints that are set on given tables, which allows DBAs to turn constraints off and on during database operations, e.g.:

ALTER TABLE tableName
    ADD CONSTRAINT constraintName

    someConstraint;

Can you imagine when, if ever, you might want to separate a constraint from the table definition it modifies? If so, describe the circumstances; if not, explain why not.

Please capture all your queries,  results, and explanations to files and submit through Blackboard.  Email submission will not be accepted.







Assingment 3

In this assignment, we continue to work with the Centrepointe church databse.
1.    Inner and outer joins.

If possible, write SQL queries to do the following.

        Get the names and mandate statements of all teams along with the ID of their “chair” member. If a chair member does not exist, include NULL for the ID.
	        [Optional] If you’re looking for a challenge, modify the previous query to return the chair person’s full name instead of just their ID.

Store your results in assignment03_1.sql
2.    Aggregation and grouping

If possible, write SQL queries to do the following.

        Compute the average age of all the people in the database. Note you can use the following Oracle features in this query.
	            MONTHS_BETWEEN(laterDate, earlierDate) computes the number of months between the earlier and later dates.
		                SYSDATE gives the current date.
				            TRUNC() rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

This query uses an agregate function, but is it doing grouping? If so, what is the group? If not, what is it doing instead?

b. Get the household ID and count of members of all households in Grand Rapids having at least 2 members. Order the results by decreasing size.

c. Modify the previous query to retrieve the phone number of the household as well.

Store your results in assignment03_1.sql.
3.    Creating and Using Views

Create a view that for the CPDB “birthday czar” that includes each person’s full name, age (using TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, birthdate)/12) ) and birthdate (only), and then write commands that:

        Retrieve the GenX people from the database (i.e., those born from 1961–1975).
	        Update the Person base table to include a GenX birthdate for some person who had a NULL birthdate before. Now, try to re-run your query on the view from the previous question. Do the results of the view query change? Why or why not?
		        Insert a new person using your new view. If this doesn’t work, explain the modifications you’d have to make to your view so that it does. Be sure that you understand what is required for a view to be updateable and what happens to the fields of the new record in the base table that are not included in the view.
			        Drop your new view. Does this affect your base tables in any way?
				        Repeat the previous exercise, but this time use a materialized view. Pay attention to what changes in the view and in the table respectively.

Note that to create a (potentially updateable) materialized view, use:

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW … [FOR UPDATE] AS

    SELECT …

Store your results in assignment03_2.sql.
